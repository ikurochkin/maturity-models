# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) maturity model by Joel Parker Henderson

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (processes, bare-metal servers, virtual servers, etc.) and their configuration through machine-processable files (source code, scripts, declarative files, dotfiles, etc.) rather than physical hardware configuration or the use of interactive tools.

See Wikipedia:
* [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)
* [Continuous configuration automatiion (CCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_configuration_automation)
* [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)
* [Maturity model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_model)


## Level 0: None

*  No IaC, or negligible use, or not applicable.


## Level 1: Initial + Informal

* Infrastructure as Code is in initial stages, including areas such as assessments, a trial project, a pilot, a prototype.

* Teammates on a project are starting to talking about IaC, typically with one hero or small group of people who want it.

* Code quality of the IaC code tends to be hand-rolled, or hand-tested, or hand-tooled.

* Application planning focuses on shipping code.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Use cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services.

* Use a shell script that check a server's uptime

<b>Ideas to improve:</b>

* Shift from using hand-rolled one-off installations toward using package managers such as apm, apt, brew, choco melpa, gem, pip, yum, as well as configuration management such as config files and dot files.

* Learn about any popular mainstream configuration tools, such as Ansible, Salt, Puppet, Chef.


## Level 2: Developing + Describing

* Infrastructure is developing, typically because of a team's need. Typical software at this level often includes cloud services (e.g. AWS), containerization (e.g. Docker), configuration management (e.g. Ansible), orchestration tooling (e.g. Kubernetes), continuous delivery software (e.g. GoCD), and potentially platform as a service offerings (e.g. Heroku).

* Teammates from the department  are talking about IaC, and working on ways to use IaC to help the department across multiple projects.

* Code quality is starting to use automated tests for the IaC code, in addition to application code.

* IaC proponents develop and describe cross-functional areas, such as Cost (reduction), Speed (execution), and Risk (mitigation).

* Application planning includes documentation, ideally orienting toward developing various cookbooks, recipies, manifests, blueprints, as well as developer operations (devops) such as continuous integration, deployment pipelines as an integral part of the application delivery process, and quality assurance that covers the entire delivery pipeline.


<b>Examples:</b>

* There are at least a few projects where a developer can commit a line of code, and the code flows into production, by using continuous integration, continuous delivery, and optionally capabilities for feature flags, throttle releases (blue/green, go/no, canary releases, etc.).

* The department shares IaC code and does IaC collaboration using source code repositories, and optionally capabilities for chat, help, documentation, wikis, planning, and the like.

<b>Ideas to improve:</b>

* Technical: Develop IaC code in ways that align with your teams' project code, such as doing code reviews, roadmap planning, idempotency testing, etc. Get familiar with all of the examples above: AWS, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, GoCD, Heroku; even if you choose to use alternatives to these, the learning will transfer well.

* Social: Share IaC code with other teams, get feedback, and improve the code and all its related capabilities for collaboration, documentation, verification, etc.


## Level 3: Standardizing + Scaling

* Infrastructure is standardizing, typically thanks to teams creating specifications, sharable code, source code repositories.

* Team members can quickly, confidently, and effectively create IaC projects, complete with end-to-end success, as well as any documentation and certification.

* Code quality aims toward service-oriented capabilities, such as APIs, discoverability, mixability.

* The approach to IaC is generally imperative and/or procedural. The imperative approach focuses on how the infrastructure is to be changed to meet the target configuration. The imperative approach defines specific commands that need to be executed to end with the desired conclusion.

* IaC proponents standardize cross-functional areas, such as Cost (reduction), Speed (execution), and Risk (mitigation). The standardization incldues specific tradeoffs, such as the cost/benefit of faster deployments, or the risk/reward of security verfications.

* Application planning includes design for self-standardization and/or self-scaling, as well as devops techniques such as immutable infrastructure, phoenix servers, IaaS, PaaS, and iPaaS.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Typically projects can be one-button deployed, including just-in-time as-needed creation of related resources, databases, networks, addresses, etc.

* IaC is in use beyond just the IT department; this may include self-service tools, such as setting up new laptops, as well as significant business tools, such as IT-business teams that can configure and deploy new services independently of IT system administrators.

<b>How to improve:</b>

* Technical: Learn how to modularize Iac code and distribute it, such as by using package managers, modules, libraries, functional decomposition, idempotency testing, hot reloads, etc.

* Social: Explicity plan for good governance. Governance includes technical areas such as versioning and release management, team areas such as five-why root cause analysis and blameless retrospectives, and management areas such as budgeting and approvals.


## Level 4: Managing + Measuring + Missions

* Infrastructure is managed and measured in concert with explicit mission statements. Good candidates are [OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results), [KPI (Key Performance Indicator) metrics](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator), and a [Strategic Balanced Scorecard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_balanced_scorecard).

* Team members can easily use scoreboards, dashboards, metrics, measurments, and similar data-driven tooling to run, upgrade, and verify IaC code. IT executive leadership can easily use rollup systems to prove IT-business capabilities and cost justifications.

* Code quality is consistently measured and tested using continuous delivery tooling, automated code quality vetting, scaling benchmarking, etc.

* The approach to IaC is generally declarative and/or functional. The declarative approach focuses on what the eventual target configuration should be. The declarative approach defines the desired state, and the system executes what needs to happen to achieve that desired state.

* IaC proponents prove success in cross-functional areas, such as Cost (reduction), Speed (execution), and Risk (mitigation). The proof includes data for cost/benefit of faster deployments, risk/reward of security verifications, etc.

* Application planning includes design for self-management and/or self-measurement.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Many projects are one-button initiated, end-to-end, from sunrise to sunset. This can include Application Lifcycle Management (ALM),
Porfolio Programme Project Management (PPPM), best practices, maturity model matching, etc.

* IaC tooling emits metrics, which in turn are useful for Application Performance Monitoring (APM), synthetic monitoring, debugging, and capability growth planning.

<b>How to improve:</b>

* Technical: improve code so it's suitable for mainstream usage. This includes thorough test coverage for corner cases, failure modes, chaos interruptions, outage mitigations.

* Social: Plan IaC in terms of long-term management and mainstream usage, including roadmaps for lifecycle management, funding management, communication management, value stream mapping, and governance management.


## Level 5: Optimizing + Orchestrating + Opportunities

* Infrastructure research and development is funded to create new products and services, and also new business opportunities.

* Code quality is consistently able evolve, and welcomes contributions, discussions, and usage by the entire organization, and potentially its partners, vendors, customers, and the public.

* The approach to IaC is orchestral and environmentatlly aware. The orchestral approach focuses on why the configuration should be a certain way in consideration of all the co-relationships and co-dependencies of multiple applications running on the same infrastructure typically found in production.

* IaC proponents optimize success in cross-functional areas, such as Cost (reduction), Speed (execution), and Risk (mitigation). The optimization includes data for cost/benefit of faster deployments, risk/reward of security verifications, etc. The optimization also includes strategic look-ahead to drive organizational investment in these cross-functional areas.

* Application planning includes design for self-optimization and/or self-healing.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Amazon creating AWS, Google creating GCS, Facebook creating React, Netflix creating many open source projects.

* Orchestrating among multiple clouds, internal and external, with tools such as Kubernetes and Mesos.

<b>How to improve:</b>

* Create code that inspires people to grow more IaC capabilities. This includes publicizing the code, such as blogging about it, creating help channels for it, and teaching how to use it.

* Use IT to drive strategic opportunities, such as investments in companies, products, and people.
