## Level O: None

No Enterprise Architecture in place.

1. No recognition for the need for Enterprise Architecture. Success depends on individual efforts.
2. Enterprise Architecture Development methods ignored.
3. Business requirements specific to a problem.
4. Stakeholders limited to users of the solution.
5. Product focussed.
6. Specifications delivered after the solution.
7. Governance seen as bureaucracy.
8. Architecture projects considered to be time-wasting â€“ lets get down to that code!
9. Legacy management is spiraling out of control.
10. Benefits are not measured.


## Level 1: Initial

Informal Enterprise Architecture Process Underway.

1. Processes are ad hoc and localized. Some Enterprise Architecture processes are defined. There is no unified architecture process across technologies or business processes. Success depends on individual efforts.
2. Enterprise Architecture processes, documentation and standards are established by a variety of ad hoc means and are localized or informal.
3. Minimal, or implicit linkage to business strategies or business drivers.
4. Limited management team awareness or involvement in the architecture process.
5. Non-existent. Enterprise Architectures under development
6. The latest version of the Enterprise Architecture documentation is on the Web. Little communication exists about the Enterprise Architecture process and possible process improvements.
7. No explicit governance of architectural standards.
8. No Enterprise Architecture projects.
9. Legacy architectures not subject to Architecture Change Management.
10. No benefits achieved from the Enterprise Architecture Program.


## Level 2: Under Development

Enterprise Architecture Process Is Under Development.

1. Enterprise Vision, Principles, Business Linkages, Baseline, and Target Architecture are identified. Architecture standards exist, but not necessarily linked to Target Architecture. Technical Reference Model and Standards Profile framework established.
2. Basic Enterprise Architecture Process program is documented. The architecture process has developed clear roles and responsibilities.
3. Explicit linkage to business strategies.
4. Management awareness of Architecture effort.
5. Foundation architecture defined. Responsibilities are assigned and work is underway on common systems architectures.
6. The Enterprise Architecture Web Pages are updated periodically and is used to document architecture.
deliverables. Process modeling tools used.
7. Governance of a few architectural standards and some adherence to existing Standards Profile.
8. Architecture Projects linked with Project Management methodology.
9. Little or no formal governance of existing Legacy architectures.
10. Potential Enterprise benefits realised.


## Level 3: Defined

Defined Enterprise Architecture Including Detailed Written Procedures and Technical Reference Model

1. The architecture is well defined and communicated to IT staff and business management. The process is largely followed.
2. Gap Analysis and Migration Plan are completed. Fully developed Technical Reference Model and Standards Profile. IT goals and methods are identified.
3. Enterprise Architecture is underwritten by the business operations.
4. Senior-management team aware of and supportive of the enterprise-wide architecture process. Management actively supports architectural standards.
5. Architecture Building Blocks are translated into Solution Building Blocks and agreed by the business
6. Architecture documents updated regularly on Enterprise Architecture Web Page.
7. Explicit documented governance of majority Enterprise investments.
8. Critical Architecture Projects under Programme and Project management control.
9. Architecture Governance commences. Architecture Board operational, Compliance reviews started.
10. IT acquisition strategy exists and includes compliance measures to Enterprise Architecture. Cost-benefits are considered in identifying projects.


## Level 4: Managed

Managed and Measured Enterprise Architecture Process.

1. Enterprise Architecture process is part of the culture. Quality metrics associated with the architecture process are captured.
2. Enterprise Architecture documentation is updated on a regular cycle to reflect the updated IT Architecture. Business, Information, Application & Data, Technology Architectures defined.
3. Capital planning and investment control are adjusted based on the feedback received and lessons learned from updated Enterprise Architecture. Periodic reexamination of business drivers.
4. Senior-management team directly involved in the architecture review process.
5. The Enterprise Continuum defined and re-use of architecture artifacts is best practice.
6. Enterprise repository set up and Architecture descriptions are updated regularly, and frequently reviewed for latest architecture developments/standards.
7. Explicit governance of all IT investments. Formal processes for managing variances feed back into Enterprise Architecture.
8. All Enterprise Architecture Projects prioritised and majority under Programme & Projects management
9. Asset Management of legacy architecture and related new initiatives managed through the change management process.
10. Benefits of Enterprise Architecture realised for initial projects.


## Level 5: Optimizing

Continuous Improvement of Enterprise Architecture Process.

1. Enterprise Architecture principles and process optimize and continuously improved.
2. Fully operational ADM with continuous improvement activities.
3. Architecture process metrics are used to optimize and drive business linkages. Business involved in the continuous process improvements of Enterprise Architecture.
4. Senior management involvement in optimizing process improvements in Architecture development and governance.
5. Enterprise Continuum fully operational with compatible Industry Enterprise Products & Solutions.
6. Architecture documents and descriptions are used by every decision maker in the organization for every ITrelated business decision.
7. Explicit governance of all IT investments. Continuous Improvement of governance-process and related Service delivery.
8. No unplanned IT investment or acquisition activity. Architecture projects integrated with Ser
9. Portfolio Management of Architecture projects and Service delivery.
10. Investment Management & Value assessment of Enterprise Architecture built into the P&L.
