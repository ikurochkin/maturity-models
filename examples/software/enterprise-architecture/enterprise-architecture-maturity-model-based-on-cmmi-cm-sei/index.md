This Enterprise Architecture Maturity Model is based on the
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for Software
by the Carnegie-Mellon Software Engineering Institute (CM SEI).

<h2>Level 2: Under Development</h2>

* Enterprise Architecture Processes are under development.
* Basic Enterprise Architecture Process.
* The Enterprise Architecture process has developed clear roles and responsibilities.

* Reference Architecture Models are established.
* Explicit linkage to Business and IT Strategies.
* Management awareness of Enterprise Architecture effort.
* Responsibilities are assigned and work is underway.
* The Enterprise Architecture Web Pages are updated periodically and are used to document Enterprise Architecture deliverables.

* Governance of a few Enterprise Architecture standards and some adherence to existing Standards.
* Little or no formal governance of IT Investment and Acquisition Strategy.
* Organisation units demonstrate some adherence to existing Standards.


<h2>Level 3: Defined</h2>

* Defined Enterprise Architecture including detailed written guidelines and Reference Architecture Models.
