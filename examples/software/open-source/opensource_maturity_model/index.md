# OpenSource Maturity Model

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model

The Open Source Maturity Model (OMM) is a methodology for assessing Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) and more specifically the FLOSS development process.

## OMM objectives

OMM objectives are:

1. To provide FLOSS communities a basis for developing products efficiently and making their products trustworthy for the potential customers, and also for integrating companies.

2. To provide FLOSS integrators a basis for evaluating the processes used by the FLOSS communities.


## OMM is a model and methodology

OMM is interchangeably referred to as model and methodology.

1. It is first a model that contains all elements that have to be assessed.

2. It is also a set of rules and guidelines describing how to conduct the assessment process.


## OMM levels

OMM is organized in levels, each level is building on and including the trustworthy elements (TWE) at the lower level:

1. Basic level
2. Intermediate level
3. Advanced level
